        <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>As you might be able to tell from the <strong>picture on the left</strong>, I love to travel and eat <em>lots</em> of good food. When I was young, I spent three weeks in France with my grandparents. On three separate occasions I visited Japan, once in 2003 for a high school exchange program, then again in 2007 to study Japanese and finally from 2010-2011 to teach English. I've been to Hawaii several times and Mexico twice. On my trip to <span>Puerto Vallarta</span> in 2018 I booked a wonderful seafood tour with <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/61449130" target="_blank">Memo, through AirBnB</a> and got to enjoy fresh mussels and oysters on the beach and Ceviche made in the local fashion. Although I haven't had much time to cook for myself in the last few years, due to our recent stay at home orders, I've had time to rediscover my joy of cooking and baking. In my spare time, I also enjoy reading good books, gardening (though I've got a bit of a brown thumb) and watching Netflix with my husband Marc and dog Gemma.After buying our first home in April 2019, I've been learning lots of new skills such as how to fix a hole in our drywall and how to do some simple electrical work, thanks to a class I took through <a href="https://www.rebuildingcenter.org/education" target="_blank">Portland's ReBuilding Center</a>.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>Thanks to Running Start, a program that allows high school students to attend college, I graduated from high school with an Associate of Arts. Most of the classes I took during my two years at community college focused on painting, drawing and language. Afterwards, I followed my brother to Bellingham, WA. where I received a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Japanese. Although I also studied Chinese and Arabic at University, I remember only a few sentences of each. After teaching English in Japan for a year, I completed and intensive SIT TESOL course at Rennert International in New York, NY., but eventually decided to explore other options. In 2016 I graduated from Portland Community College with an Associate of Science in Dental Hygiene.
