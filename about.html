        <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>As you might be able to tell from the <strong>picture on the left</strong>, I love to travel and eat <em>lots</em> of good food. When I was young, I spent three weeks in France with my grandparents. On three separate occasions I visited Japan, once in 2003 for a high school exchange program, then again in 2007 to study Japanese and finally from 2010-2011 to teach English. I've been to Hawaii several times and Mexico twice. On my trip to <span>Puerto Vallarta</span> in 2018 I booked a wonderful seafood tour with <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/61449130" target="_blank">Memo, through AirBnB</a> and got to enjoy fresh mussels and oysters on the beach and Ceviche made in the local fashion. Although I haven't had much time to cook for myself in the last few years, due to our recent stay at home orders, I've had time to rediscover my joy of cooking and baking. In my spare time, I also enjoy reading good books, gardening (though I've got a bit of a brown thumb) and watching Netflix with my husband Marc and dog Gemma.After buying our first home in April 2019, I've been learning lots of new skills such as how to fix a hole in our drywall and how to do some simple electrical work, thanks to a class I took through <a href="https://www.rebuildingcenter.org/education" target="_blank">Portland's ReBuilding Center</a>.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p class="background">Thanks to Running Start, a program that allows high school students to attend college, I graduated from high school with an Associate of Arts. Most of the classes I took during my two years at community college focused on painting, drawing and language. Afterwards, I followed my brother to Bellingham, WA. where I received a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Japanese. Although I also studied Chinese and Arabic at University, I remember only a few sentences of each. After teaching English in Japan for a year, I completed and intensive SIT TESOL course at Rennert International in New York, NY., but eventually decided to explore other options. In 2016 I graduated from Portland Community College with an Associate of Science in Dental Hygiene.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p class="background">I worked several part time positions to help pay for college, which included managing a crew at my Universities dining hall and managing at a sandwich shop as well as cleaning dormitories and working at a motel. In my opinion though, the first "official adult" job I was hired for was teaching English in a little prefecture in Japan. I lived there for about a year before returning to the states to begin teaching ESL in Portland, OR at Kaplan International Centers. Once I decided to study Dental Hygiene, I worked another part time job at the local movie theater just to help pay the bills. Upon graduating with my degree and receiving my license in 2016, I began working for Willamette Dental Group, first at the Beaverton clinic and then at the Weidler clinic where I have been for the past three and a half years.

          <h2>Why Programming</h2>
          <p class="background">There are many things about dental hygiene that I enjoy, but I sensed early on that it may not be sustainable to me. I experienced constant neck and back pain and began to "throw my back out" more and more often. I began exploring different hobbies that could become future careers and the one I enjoyed the most, the one that stuck, was coding. My husband had gotten a Raspberry Pi and begun to programm it using Arduino. I remember thinking to myself in my early twenties that I could never learn to program, but now, older and with a stronger sense of self efficacy, I was interested in trying it out. After all, what is coding, I thought to myself. It's just a language. And I had enjoyed studying languages throughout my whole life, so why not give it a try. I began with a Web Design course by Sefan Mischook and soon found myself dragging my laptop with me on vacation to Mexico and Hawaii just so I could continue to practice. It felt like magic to refresh the browser and watch things change on the screen. Every new trick I learned, every problem I worked out, felt like a victory. Eventually, after 3 years of slowly learning on my own and doing <em>lots</em> of research and planning, I decided it was time to sign up for a programming bootcamp and transition into the next phase of my life.</p>
