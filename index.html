        <h4>My First Webpage</h4>

        <h4>Branching Test Site</h4>

        <h4>Gemma's Webpage</h4>
        <p>This project was very fun for me because I love talking about my dog, Gemma.

        <h4>Blogging Site</h4>
        <p>I am always happy to talk about, write about, think about and eat food. I am a food lover at heart, so this blog post uses CSS styles, divs and images to display just a few of the many meals I made during my first week of social distancing.

        <h4>Boring Lecture</h4>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to practice using Lorem Ipsum and to style using CSS class selectors.

        <h4>Vacation Destination</h4>
        <p>Here is the first project build with the use of Bootstrap. The goal was to create a site featuring a place I would like to visit. The only difficult thing about this project was choosing just one place! It was very fun however, to learn more about the food and activities in Wales, which is the location I chose.
